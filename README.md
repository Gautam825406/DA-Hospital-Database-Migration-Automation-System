# 🏥 Hospital Database Creation and Data Migration

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a robust **relational database system** for hospital operations by migrating existing **Excel-based records** into a structured MySQL database.  
The solution enforces **data integrity**, **automation of business rules**, **secure access control**, and **analytical reporting**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The hospital previously managed patient records, doctor details, appointments, prescriptions, lab reports, and billing information using Excel files.  
As operations scaled, this approach became inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to maintain.

This project aims to replace the Excel-based system with a **scalable, secure, and automated database solution**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a normalized relational database for hospital management
- Migrate Excel data into structured database tables
- Enforce referential integrity and data validation
- Prevent invalid and duplicate appointment entries
- Implement role-based access to sensitive patient data
- Generate department-wise monthly revenue reports

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Language:** SQL  
- **Data Source:** Excel / CSV  
- **Tool:** MySQL Workbench  

---

## 🧱 Database Design
### Core Tables
- Departments  
- Doctors  
- Patients  
- Appointments  
- Prescriptions  
- LabReports  
- Bills  

### Relationships
- One department → many doctors  
- One doctor → many appointments  
- One patient → many appointments  
- One appointment → prescriptions, lab reports, bills  

Foreign key constraints ensure **referential integrity** across all tables.

---

## 🔄 Data Migration Strategy
- Auto-increment primary keys generated by the database
- Empty strings converted to NULL or filtered
- Dates standardized using `STR_TO_DATE()`
- Invalid records excluded during insertion

This ensures **clean, consistent, and reliable data migration**.

---

## ✅ Data Validation & Business Rules
- Gender restricted to `'M'`, `'F'`, `'O'`
- Appointment status restricted to:
  - `Scheduled`
  - `Completed`
  - `Cancelled`

### Appointment Automation
A trigger prevents:
- Appointments scheduled in the past
- Double-booking of doctors at the same time

---

## 🔐 Security & Access Control
Role-based access is implemented using stored procedures:

- **Senior Doctors:**  
  Can view all patients within their department

- **Other Doctors:**  
  Can view only their assigned patients’ details (appointments, prescriptions, lab reports)

This ensures **data privacy and controlled access**.

---

## 📊 Reporting & Analytics
A stored procedure generates:
- **Monthly revenue reports by department**

This enables hospital management to analyze financial performance efficiently.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
- Fully normalized relational database
- Enforced data integrity and constraints

---

## 📝 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the successful migration of hospital data from Excel into a **secure, automated, and scalable relational database system**.  
By enforcing business rules and enabling analytical reporting, the system significantly improves hospital data management and operational efficiency.
